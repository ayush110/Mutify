Automatically mutes ads on Spotify 

Currently working on expanding functionality of program to utilize Spotify API and several Youtube API's to:

  1) track listening history and export as CSV file
  2) create playlists based off of liked songs on Youtube
  3) Anything else thats cool! (Maybe implementing a machine learning algorithm)
 
Download the Chrome WebDriver to start using. 
You also have to add your Spotify username and password in the empty "" in utils.py (Note - this program is practically useless if you have Spotify Premium)!
